Thanks to my friends from the [ICFP Contest](https://twitter.com/icfpcontest2020/status/1278965948461056000), it was a tremendous success.\\n\\nWith help from enthusiasts all over the world we were able to make [great progress](https://message-from-space.readthedocs.io/en/latest/radio-transmission-recording.html) in understanding the message. Thank you very much to all the participants!\\n\\nFirst of all, we understand that the signal is probably a sequence of frequency-encoded ones and zeroes. When arranged into a particular two-dimensional grid they look like a picture that makes sense to a human eye!\\n\\n![transmission signal in 2d](images/radio-transmission-2d.png)\\n\\nSecond, we have some theories on how to interpret this picture. It looks like a binary encoding of numbers from 1 to 8 that follows a regular pattern that can be extended further to construct any natural number. However, we don\u2019t have any hard data to support our construction\u2026\\n\\n![how to encode numbers](images/numbers-encoding4.png)\\n\\nOkay, here is the exciting part! I just got a second message! I\u2019m going to apply the code I got from you yesterday to convert this second signal into a picture. I\u2019ll post this picture to [a separate page](https://message-from-space.readthedocs.io/en/latest/message2.html) in our documentation so we can collaborate on the explanation.\\n\\nSo excited!

I\'m a staff astronomer at Pegovka observatory in the Urals region of Russia.\\n\\nSeveral days ago we have been monitoring radio signals from a small region of sky around [HD 190360](http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=HD+190360) for our exoplanet research purposes. We have registered a peculiar radio transmission which cannot be attributed to any natural source in this area.\\n\\nWe tried to analyze and decode this message. But we don\'t have any trained deciphering specialists here on site, and we don\'t have appropriate software to analyze this message. We have made very little progress so far.\\n\\nI believe that decoding this message can lead to a major breakthrough in our understanding of the Universe. I believe that science should be a joint effort. Together we can crack this problem much faster that any single research group.\\n\\nThat\'s why I decided to publish a [recording of this message](https://message-from-space.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_downloads/822b494d13eb35a97f159e041a004fa9/radio-transmission-recording.wav) and create a [special documentation page](https://message-from-space.readthedocs.io/en/latest/radio-transmission-recording.html) to collaborate on the explanation.\\n\\nIf you have any idea at all on how to decode and explain the message, please send a Pull Request to the [appropriate page](https://github.com/zaitsev85/message-from-space/blob/master/source/radio-transmission-recording.rst)! We cannot move forward without this!\\n\\nSincerely,\\nIvan Zaitsev\\n\\nP.S.
