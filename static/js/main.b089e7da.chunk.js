I don\u2019t see the point in doing this, because all the transmissions so far seem uniform. Sharing images is much more convenient than sharing WAV files: image files consume less bandwidth and are much easier to comprehend visually.\\n\\nBut thinking about this and discussing this idea inspired our team to further investigate the variations in strength and carrier frequency of the transmissions. \\n\\nFirst of all, the carrier frequency decreases over time. This kind of observation is usually explained by the Doppler effect and suggests that the source is accelerating in a direction away from us.\\n\\nSecond, the strength of the signal increases ever-so-slightly from one transmission to another. This effect suggests that the source is moving towards us.\\n\\nWe\u2019re not ready to make any hard statements at this time. Our equipment is not perfect, and this effect can be caused by slight deviations of the positioning of our antenna. But if true, these observations may suggest that the source of the transmissions is moving towards the Earth and is slowing down.\\n\\nAs usual, join us in the [Discord chat](https://discord.gg/xvMJbas) to decipher [today\u2019s message](https://message-from-space.readthedocs.io/en/latest/message10.html)."},{"id":1030,"date":"2020-07-10T17:59:56.834+05:00","author":"Ivan Zaitsev","title":"Not a Reflection Either","text":"We\u2019re still receiving regular radio transmissions from the same region of the sky.

Thank you very much to all the participants!\\n\\nFirst of all, we understand that the signal is probably a sequence of frequency-encoded ones and zeroes. When arranged into a particular two-dimensional grid they look like a picture that makes sense to a human eye!\\n\\n![transmission signal in 2d](images/radio-transmission-2d.png)\\n\\nSecond, we have some theories on how to interpret this picture. It looks like a binary encoding of numbers from 1 to 8 that follows a regular pattern that can be extended further to construct any natural number.

I\'m a staff astronomer at Pegovka observatory in the Urals region of Russia.\\n\\nSeveral days ago we have been monitoring radio signals from a small region of sky around [HD 190360](http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=HD+190360) for our exoplanet research purposes. We have registered a peculiar radio transmission which cannot be attributed to any natural source in this area.\\n\\nWe tried to analyze and decode this message. But we don\'t have any trained deciphering specialists here on site, and we don\'t have appropriate software to analyze this message. We have made very little progress so far.\\n\\nI believe that decoding this message can lead to a major breakthrough in our understanding of the Universe. I believe that science should be a joint effort. Together we can crack this problem much faster that any single research group.\\n\\nThat\'s why I decided to publish a [recording of this message](https://message-from-space.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_downloads/822b494d13eb35a97f159e041a004fa9/radio-transmission-recording.wav) and create a [special documentation page](https://message-from-space.readthedocs.io/en/latest/radio-transmission-recording.html) to collaborate on the explanation.\\n\\nIf you have any idea at all on how to decode and explain the message, please send a Pull Request to the [appropriate page](https://github.com/zaitsev85/message-from-space/blob/master/source/radio-transmission-recording.rst)!
